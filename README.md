# product-compare-vue
Vue conversion of  Rhymond/product-compare-react

I took the simplest way here: no Vue CLI, no single-file components, no web host, no SCSS, no app state, no complexity, using CDN-hosted dependencies.

To start the site, just open Index.html in a browser (or write your own web host).

Let me know if you need further tweaks or if you find likely bugs that need fixing; if not, I will consider it done for now.
